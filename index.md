### P-Hacking ICRA

*2025 June 16*

The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) took place in May, and I didn't goâ€”probably because I didn't submit anything to it. Despite not attending, I do care about what happened at ICRA, because I care about staying up-to-date with the robotics field. I have had the opportunity to talk to a couple of people who did go. The main vibe I got aligned with what Chris Paxton states in his blog: ICRA was more serious this year... [Read More â†’](/posts/p_hacking_icra/)

## About

Welcome to my "blog". I'm trying to use this space to write about things I think are interesting or useful, most likely about robotics or machine learning. I also want this to be a place where I can get things *wrong*.
