The story went like this: if you use an ML algorithm that is too simplistic for your data, the algorithm will be too *biased* and perform poorly on both the train and test set. Fair enough. On the other hand, the story continues, if your algorithm is too expressive and complex... [Read More â†’](/posts/overfitting_is_fine)
