### Reliable Robots Really Require Remarkable Robustness

*2025 May 27*

I want to start with a hypothetical thought experiment. Imagine you are the world's best roboticist and just trained from scratch a spectacular end-to-end policy for opening a washing machine door. In a slight lapse of judgement, you only trained on examples of *front-loading* washers. Then, full of excitement, you take your robot (and trained policy) to your grandma's house. Let's say that, unbeknownst to you, she happens to have a *top-loading* washer. Well... [Read More â†’](/posts/robustness_and_robotics/)

## About

Welcome to my "blog". I'm trying to use this space to write about things I think are interesting or useful, most likely about robotics or machine learning. I also want this to be a place where I can get things *wrong*.
