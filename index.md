### There are Free Lunches in Robotics

*2025 July 18*

I attended a fair amount of seminars back at the University of Utah. I remember some of them providing free foodâ€”a glorious sight to starving college student.

## About

Welcome to my "blog". I'm trying to use this space to write about things I think are interesting or useful, most likely about robotics or machine learning. I also want this to be a place where I can get things *wrong*.
