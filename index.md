### The Dumbest Way to Get 3rd Place in Your Class Kaggle Competition

*2025 July 3*

Picture this: it's the spring semester of 2023. I'm fidgeting with a pen in a packed basement classroom as my professor introduces the final projectâ€”a competition. Nothing gets me going like a competition where doing well doesn't actually earn you any extra points towards a grade and is solely for bragging rights!
